        "In practice, differential equations are usually much more complex than the one-dimensional linear example above, and finding the analytical solution of $x(t)$ is not as straightforward. A common approach is to compute the solution to the equation numerically. To do so, we model time as a series of time steps $t_0, t_1, t_2, ...$, such that $t_{i+1} = t_i + dt$. Over a small time interval $dt$, we can get the corresponding change $dx$ from the definition of the differential:\n",

        "This very simple integration scheme, known as **forward Euler integration**, works well if  $dt$  is small and the ordinary differential equation is simple. It can run into issues when the ordinary differential equation is very noisy or when the dynamics include sudden big changes of  $x$. Such big jumps can occur, for example, in models of excitable neurons. In such cases, one needs to choose an integration scheme carefully. Note that differential equation solvers like *ode45* in MATLAB and *solve_ivp* in Python's scipy package use numerical methods similar in spirit to forward Euler integration, but which compute a higher order approximation of $dx$ (they evaluate $\\dot x$ at several points, not just once at $t_{i−1}$ as we did here)."

The second equation is equivalent to writing $\\ddot \\theta = -\\frac{g}{L} \\sin(\\theta)$. This is where the physics of the system come into play.

How does the pendulum's angular position ($x_1 = \\theta$) and angular velocity ($x_2 = \\dot \\theta$) evolve through time if we were to initialize the system with certain initial conditions? A cooler way of saying the same thing is how does our dynamical system evolve through its **state space**? In this case, the initial conditions would be the initial angle of the pendulum (denoted $x_1(0)$) and the initial angular velocity of the pendulum (denoted $x_2(0)$). Once we start the system with some initial conditions, the rules of physics take over and the pendulum updates based on our dynamical equation."

The dynamics of a latent state $z(t)$ (usually of lower dimension than the number of neurons) are distributed across the firing rates $x(t)$ of a population of neurons to carry out computations which result in a certain output behavior. The dynamics of the latent state are described as follows:\n",
